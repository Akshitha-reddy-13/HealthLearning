# Endometrial cancer Prediction Dataset 

Welcome to the Endometrial cancer Prediction Dataset! ðŸŽ‰ This dataset contains information about endometrial cancer, also known as endometrial carcinoma, which is a type of cancer that starts in the cells of the inner lining of the uterus (the endometrium). Endometrial carcinomas can be categorized into different types based on cellular characteristics observed under a microscope.

## Cause of Uterine Cancer

The exact cause of uterine cancer is not fully understood. However, it is believed that mutations occur in the cells of the uterus, causing them to grow and multiply uncontrollably, leading to the formation of tumors.

## MSI Mantis Score
The MANTIS score is a predictive score for a patient's MSI (Microsatellite Instability) status. A higher MANTIS score indicates a higher likelihood of MSI-H (high microsatellite instability) status.

## MSI Sensor
MSIsensor is a tool used for microsatellite instability detection using paired tumor-normal sequence data. The resulting MSIsensor score is a value between 0 and 100, indicating the percentage of mutated microsatellite loci.

## Usage
- Researchers and healthcare professionals can utilize this dataset for studying endometrial cancer and its various types.
- ial and should be used only for educational purposes.
