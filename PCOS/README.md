# What is PCOS?

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal imbalance disorder affecting women of reproductive age. It is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, excess androgen (male hormone) levels, and the presence of multiple small cysts in the ovaries. Women with PCOS may experience various symptoms, including weight gain, acne, and difficulty getting pregnant.

# Importance of the Subject

PCOS is a prevalent health concern affecting a significant portion of the female population. Early diagnosis and management of PCOS are crucial to prevent long-term complications such as infertility, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Access to accurate datasets plays a vital role in developing effective diagnostic tools and treatment strategies.

# Methods

Machine learning and deep learning techniques have shown promise in analyzing medical data to improve PCOS diagnosis and treatment. Datasets like the one presented here can be used to train and validate models for:

- Predicting the risk of PCOS based on a patient's medical history, blood tests, and other clinical data.
- Identifying PCOS subtypes with distinct clinical presentations for personalized treatment plans.
- Developing decision-support systems to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and managing PCOS.
