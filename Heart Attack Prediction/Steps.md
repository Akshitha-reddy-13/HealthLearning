# Heart Attack Prediction

## 1. Dataset Exploration

+ Load the dataset

+ Explore and confirm features and label(s) of this dataset

+ Explore size/shape of dataset

+ Explore data - Data Dictionary

+ Calculate the memory usage differences

+ Explore the statistical facts like mean, median, x percentiles of the columns

## 2. EDA

+ Univariate Analysis 
    - Count plot of categorical features    
    - Boxen plot of continuous features
    - Count plot of target

+ Bivariate Analysis
    - Correlation matrix of continuous features
    - Scatterplot heatmap of dataframe
    - Distribution of continuous features according to target variable
    - Some other relations that seemed intuitive
    - Pairplot according to target variable - one plot to rule them all

## 3. Data Processing

+ Conclusions from EDA

+ Importing Packages

+ Making features model ready

## 4. Modeling

+ Linear Classifiers
    - Support Vector Machines
    - Hyperparameter tuning of SVC
    - Logistic Regression
    - ROC Curve

+ Tree Models
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
    - Gradient Boosting Classifier - without tuning
