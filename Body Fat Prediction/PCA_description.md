# Analysis Description

This analysis performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a dataset to analyze the variance explained by each principal component and the cumulative variance explained by all principal components.

## Purpose
The purpose of this code is to:
- Implement PCA on the dataset
- Visualize the variance explained by each principal component
- Visualize the cumulative variance explained by all principal components
- Rank the features based on their importance in explaining the variance in the dataset

## Methods Used
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Visualization using Matplotlib

## Results
The analysis reveals insights into the importance of each feature in the dataset and helps in making informed decisions about feature selection and model building.

## Conclusion
Based on the cumulative variance explained ratio plot, the features can be ranked according to their importance in explaining the variance in the dataset.
